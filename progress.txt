## Codebase Patterns
- Keep pipeline outputs deterministic under outputs/
- Config values must be in config/*.json (no hardcoded thresholds)
- Python packages live in src/market_forensics/ with submodules: data/, events/, windows/, metrics/, plots/
- Use python3 (not python) for commands on macOS
- Sample data goes in data/sample/

## [2026-02-02 13:35] - MF-001
- What was implemented:
  - Created project directory structure: src/market_forensics/, data/sample/, outputs/{windows,metrics,plots}/, config/
  - Added config/default.json with exchange, symbols, event detection thresholds, window sizes
  - Added config loader utility in src/market_forensics/config.py
  - Updated README.md with project overview, structure, and "How to run" section
- Files changed:
  - README.md (updated)
  - config/default.json (new)
  - src/market_forensics/__init__.py (new)
  - src/market_forensics/config.py (new)
  - src/market_forensics/{data,events,windows,metrics,plots}/__init__.py (new)
  - data/sample/.gitkeep, outputs/*/.gitkeep (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use python3 instead of python on macOS
  - Keep __init__.py files minimal with just docstrings
  - Config loader uses Path for cross-platform compatibility
