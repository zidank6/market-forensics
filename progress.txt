## Codebase Patterns
- Keep pipeline outputs deterministic under outputs/
- Config values must be in config/*.json (no hardcoded thresholds)
- Python packages live in src/market_forensics/ with submodules: data/, events/, windows/, metrics/, plots/
- Use python3 (not python) for commands on macOS
- Sample data goes in data/sample/
- Type hints must be Python 3.9 compatible: use `from __future__ import annotations` and `Union[A, B]`, `List[T]` instead of `A | B`, `list[T]`
- Data loaders validate required columns and fail loudly with DataLoadError
- Canonical data types: Trade, TopOfBook, Event (all frozen dataclasses)
- Tests live in tests/ and can run standalone: PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m tests.test_<module>
- Event detectors validate inputs and raise DetectorError for invalid parameters

## [2026-02-02 13:35] - MF-001
- What was implemented:
  - Created project directory structure: src/market_forensics/, data/sample/, outputs/{windows,metrics,plots}/, config/
  - Added config/default.json with exchange, symbols, event detection thresholds, window sizes
  - Added config loader utility in src/market_forensics/config.py
  - Updated README.md with project overview, structure, and "How to run" section
- Files changed:
  - README.md (updated)
  - config/default.json (new)
  - src/market_forensics/__init__.py (new)
  - src/market_forensics/config.py (new)
  - src/market_forensics/{data,events,windows,metrics,plots}/__init__.py (new)
  - data/sample/.gitkeep, outputs/*/.gitkeep (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use python3 instead of python on macOS
  - Keep __init__.py files minimal with just docstrings
  - Config loader uses Path for cross-platform compatibility

## [2026-02-02 14:00] - MF-002
- What was implemented:
  - Canonical data models in src/market_forensics/data/models.py: Trade, TopOfBook, Event
  - Data loaders in src/market_forensics/data/loaders.py: CSV/JSONL for trades and top-of-book
  - Sample dataset in data/sample/: trades.csv (25 trades) and tob.csv (25 snapshots)
  - Demo script scripts/load_sample_data.py to validate loading pipeline
- Files changed:
  - src/market_forensics/data/models.py (new)
  - src/market_forensics/data/loaders.py (new)
  - src/market_forensics/data/__init__.py (updated with exports)
  - src/market_forensics/config.py (fixed path calculation)
  - data/sample/trades.csv (new)
  - data/sample/tob.csv (new)
  - scripts/load_sample_data.py (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Python 3.9 requires `from __future__ import annotations` for modern type hint syntax
  - Frozen dataclasses with __post_init__ validation work well for immutable data records
  - TopOfBook has computed properties: mid_price, spread, spread_bps
  - Loaders auto-detect format from file extension (.csv, .jsonl)
  - Timestamps support ISO 8601 and Unix timestamp (seconds or milliseconds)

## [2026-02-02 14:30] - MF-003
- What was implemented:
  - Price-shock event detector in src/market_forensics/events/detector.py
  - Config-driven detection via detect_price_shocks_from_config()
  - Returns list of Event objects with timestamp, symbol, direction (up/down), magnitude
  - Rolling window approach: compares current price to reference price within window
  - Deduplication logic: keeps largest magnitude event within each window period
  - Test suite in tests/test_detector.py with 15 unit-like assertions
- Files changed:
  - src/market_forensics/events/detector.py (new)
  - src/market_forensics/events/__init__.py (updated with exports)
  - tests/__init__.py (new)
  - tests/test_detector.py (new)
  - prd.json (MF-003 passes: true)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Event detector uses DetectorError for validation failures (analogous to DataLoadError)
  - Tests can run standalone: PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m tests.test_detector
  - Edge cases covered: empty data, constant price, duplicated timestamps, unsorted timestamps
  - detect_price_shocks() accepts both List[Trade] and List[TopOfBook]
  - Event metadata includes reference_price, current_price, threshold_pct, window_seconds
