## Writing Patterns
- Always cite exact statistics from `outputs/v2_stats.json`
- Use "we" throughout (first person plural, avoid singular)
- All figures referenced by number and label
- Hedged language for any interpretive claims ("suggests", "consistent with", "may indicate")
- NEVER claim causality - only correlation
- State limitations directly and honestly

## Codebase Patterns
- Canonical data lives in `data/binance/futures_um/{SYMBOL}/canonical/{YYYY-MM-DD}/` with `trades.csv` and `tob.csv`
- Raw Binance data downloaded from https://data.binance.vision/data/futures/um/daily/
- Config files in `config/` - replication dates documented in `config/replication_dates.json`
- Use `python3` not `python` on macOS
- Script arguments via argparse for reusability

## [2026-02-02 19:15] - MF-010
- What was implemented:
  - Downloaded raw Binance data for 2024-03-29 and 2024-03-30
  - Updated `scripts/canonicalize_binance_um_day.py` to accept --date and --symbol args
  - Canonicalized both new dates (trades.csv + tob.csv)
  - Created `config/replication_dates.json` manifest documenting all 3 available dates
- Files changed:
  - `scripts/canonicalize_binance_um_day.py` - added canonicalize_day() function with argparse CLI
  - `config/replication_dates.json` - new file documenting dates
  - `data/binance/futures_um/BTCUSDT/canonical/2024-03-29/` - new canonical data
  - `data/binance/futures_um/BTCUSDT/canonical/2024-03-30/` - new canonical data
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Raw Binance files use naming convention: `{SYMBOL}-{feed}-{date}.csv`
  - Canonical files must have ISO timestamps for pipeline compatibility
  - 2024-03-29 had lower volume than 2024-03-28 (78MB vs 105MB trades)
  - 2024-03-30 was a weekend day with even lower volume (41MB trades)
---

## [2026-02-02 19:20] - MF-011
- What was implemented:
  - Created `scripts/run_replication.py` wrapper script
  - Script reads dates from `config/replication_dates.json` or accepts `--dates` CLI arg
  - Runs `python -m market_forensics.run` for each date with PYTHONPATH set
  - Outputs to `outputs/{date}/` to keep results separate
  - No modifications to `src/market_forensics/`
- Files changed:
  - `scripts/run_replication.py` - new file
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Pipeline invoked via subprocess with PYTHONPATH=src
  - Config overrides via CLI args (--trades, --tob, --output)
  - Wrapper scripts live in `scripts/`, keep `src/` untouched for analysis changes
---

## [2026-02-02 19:25] - MF-012
- What was implemented:
  - Ran pipeline on 3 distinct trading days: 2024-03-27, 2024-03-28, 2024-03-29
  - Each date produced event_orderings.csv in outputs/{date}/metrics/
  - Added 2024-03-27 (higher volatility) replacing 2024-03-30 (weekend, 0 events)
  - Updated config/replication_dates.json with final date selection
- Results:
  - 2024-03-27: 17 events, 12 windows (6 liquidity-first, 4 price-first, 2 volume-first)
  - 2024-03-28: 3 events, 2 windows (2 liquidity-first)
  - 2024-03-29: 2 events, 1 window (1 liquidity-first)
- Files changed:
  - `config/replication_dates.json` - updated dates list
  - `outputs/2024-03-27/`, `outputs/2024-03-28/`, `outputs/2024-03-29/` - pipeline outputs
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Weekend dates (Sat/Sun) have significantly lower volatility - fewer events
  - 2024-03-27 had the most activity (likely due to macro BTC volatility that week)
  - Ordering classifications vary: liquidity-first dominant but not universal
---

## [2026-02-02 19:30] - MF-013
- What was implemented:
  - Created `scripts/aggregate_results.py`
  - Reads event_orderings.csv from each date's output directory
  - Produces `outputs/replication_summary.csv` with required columns
  - Prints summary statistics to console
- Files changed:
  - `scripts/aggregate_results.py` - new file
  - `outputs/replication_summary.csv` - generated output
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use `from __future__ import annotations` for Python 3.9 compatibility
  - run_summary.json contains event counts; event_orderings.csv has per-window classifications
  - Classification field uses "liquidity-first", "price-first", "volume-first" naming
---

## [2026-02-02 19:35] - MF-014
- What was implemented:
  - Created `scripts/run_sensitivity.py`
  - Varies price_shock_threshold_pct via temporary config files (0.4, 0.5, 0.6)
  - Runs pipeline 3 times with each threshold
  - Produces `outputs/sensitivity_summary.csv`
- Results on 2024-03-27:
  - threshold=0.4%: 23 events, 16 windows (8 liq, 7 price, 1 vol)
  - threshold=0.5%: 17 events, 12 windows (6 liq, 4 price, 2 vol)
  - threshold=0.6%: 11 events, 8 windows (4 liq, 2 price, 2 vol)
- Files changed:
  - `scripts/run_sensitivity.py` - new file
  - `outputs/sensitivity_summary.csv` - generated output
  - `outputs/sensitivity_0.4/`, `outputs/sensitivity_0.5/`, `outputs/sensitivity_0.6/` - pipeline outputs
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Lower thresholds detect more events (more sensitive)
  - Liquidity-first remains the plurality classification across all thresholds
  - Use tempfile for config overrides to avoid modifying base config

## [2026-02-02 19:40] - MF-015
- What was implemented:
  - Created `scripts/generate_report.py`
  - Reads replication_summary.csv and sensitivity_summary.csv
  - Produces `outputs/replication_report.md` markdown report
  - All numbers derived from CSVs (not hardcoded)
  - Answers research question: "Is liquidity-first ordering consistent?"
- Key findings in report:
  - Liquidity-first: 60% of detected events across 3 days
  - Pattern stable across threshold variations (0.4%-0.6%)
  - Answer: "Yes, with qualifications"
- Files changed:
  - `scripts/generate_report.py` - new file
  - `outputs/replication_report.md` - generated output
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Reports should always derive numbers from generated data files
  - Include caveats about data limitations (days, symbol, exchange)
  - Structure: Executive Summary -> Data Tables -> Analysis -> Answer

## [2026-02-04 15:10] - MF-V3-002
- Section written: Abstract
- Word count: ~207 words
- Key decisions made:
  - Led with research question (understanding price shock genesis)
  - Included all key statistics from v2_stats.json
  - Used hedged language for interpretation ("consistent with", "correlation, not causation")
  - Explicitly mentioned limitations in final paragraph
- Statistics used: 452 events, 200 (44.25%) liquidity-first, 186 (41.15%) price-first, 66 (14.60%) volume-first, p = 2×10⁻⁶, 95% CI [39.6%, 48.7%], null = 33.3%
