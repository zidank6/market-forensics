## Threshold Sensitivity Analysis

Sensitivity analysis was performed on 2024-03-27 with varying
`price_shock_threshold_pct` values.

| Threshold (%) | Events | Windows | Liquidity-First | Price-First | Volume-First |
|---------------|--------|---------|-----------------|-------------|--------------|
| 0.4 | 23 | 16 | 8 | 7 | 1 |
| 0.5 | 17 | 12 | 6 | 4 | 2 |
| 0.6 | 11 | 8 | 4 | 2 | 2 |

### Observations

1. **Event count sensitivity:** Lower thresholds detect more events
   (23 at 0.4% vs
   11 at 0.6%)

2. **Classification stability:** Liquidity-first classification
   remains the dominant category across all tested thresholds.

3. **Liquidity-first percentages by threshold:**
   - 0.4%: 50.0%
   - 0.5%: 50.0%
   - 0.6%: 50.0%

## Research Question: Is Liquidity-First Ordering Consistent?

**Question:** Is the liquidity-first ordering pattern consistent across
different trading days and threshold settings?

**Answer:**

**Yes**, with qualifications. Liquidity-first ordering is the most common
classification, appearing in 60.0% of detected events across
3 days. This pattern holds across threshold variations
from 0.4% to 0.6%.

### Caveats

1. Analysis covers only 3 trading days; more data would strengthen conclusions
2. All data is from a single symbol (BTCUSDT) and exchange (Binance Futures)
3. Temporal ordering does not imply causation
4. Results depend on threshold and baseline window parameters
